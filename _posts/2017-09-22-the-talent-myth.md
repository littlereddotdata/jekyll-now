title: The Talent Myth
--- 

Rebecca Solnit talks about writing, but what she says also applies to code, which is, after all, just another form of language. 

"I sometimes think the test is not so much talent, which is not as rare as people think, but purpose or vocation, which manifests in part
as the ability to endure a lot of solitude and keep working. Before writers are writers they are readers, living in books, through books, in the lives of others that are also the heads of others, in that act that is so intimate and yet so alone."
