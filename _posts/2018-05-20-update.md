# Wins since 2017

- started new position
- continued to deliver courses on data analytics 
  - each class is different, but on top of that, each group is different as well. I've learnt a lot just by having to handle this diversity. If I had to sum up the journey, it would be: stay consistent with the learning material then concentrate on interacting according to each students unique learning patterns (it's really interesting how different people approach the same problem differently) 
- crafted new courses on data analytics
  - first time taking people on a three plus six month journey. have lots to learn on structuring a course this long especially since a lot of what we planned for has now become obsolete! as we execute, I'm beginning to identify some solid running themes that hopefully becomes a robust knowledge exoskeleton. 
- dipping toes into data engineering
  - this involves everything from containers, container orchestration, networking, distributed computing, data ingestion, pipeline and warehousing and crafting useful systems. all I can hope for is to remain a humble sponge and soak it all up. 
- continue to keep in touch with all things science
  - science always has, and continues to, fascinate me. the data-intensive sciences, in particular, is something I love to read about since there is a collision between computer science (needed for processing data) and good ol' curiousity based investigation and question-answering.
