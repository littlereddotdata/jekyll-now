this is part of a series where i write to make sense of my personal experience working with a team developing and delivering our AI Apprenticeship Program. Opinions are my own

# our course in a nutshell

personally, if there is one underlying theme to our apprenticeship program, and indeed how we want to onboard and grow our junior engineers (myself included), it would be to be able to think like designers. this is because while most learning material and courses teach us the mechanics of what to do (how to spin up a container, how to implement a logistic regression), there is less emphasis on tackling real-world challenges like: 

1. designing a data ingestion point that balances ease of use with providing users a feeling of security about their shared data  
2. designing a data warehousing pipeline for processing streaming data instead of batched data  
3, designing a metric for collecting data so that you can apply transparent and observable machine learning instead of a complicated model  
4. designing a tidy dataset that stores model metrics for easy query and analysis later  
5. designing a final Minimum Viable Product that integrates well with a client's existing infrastructure  

*for this course we researched, and indeed continue to read about, how learning and mentoring is done at work. some resources we have found helpful and include here for those also on this journey:*
