title: Can Data Make You Beautiful
--- 
And I don't mean using algorithms that suggest the best set of outfits for you, or software that matches the best hue of eyeshadow for your skin tone. 

I'm talking about interacting with data in a way that moulds your character so that your default facial expression changes. From worried to relaxed, from cautious and calculating to open. A very patient teacher I had always had welcoming eyes. You relaxed when you talked with her and watched what she did and said. She studied plant forms, spending her days gazing at leaves and flowers through an eye-glass, noting their shapes so she could classify them. The work needed calm attention. It needed an alert and observant state. I felt that many years of maintaining this state molded her character, and her looks reflected this. 

Her data (plant form) had made her beautiful.
