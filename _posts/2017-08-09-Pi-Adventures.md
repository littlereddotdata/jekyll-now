A pretty momentous thing just happened - I bought myself a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. I say momentous because it opened up a new world to explore: the world of digital making. 

Digital making means creating something with technology and, through the process, *learning about how the technology works*. It's much better than reading a book and imagining what might happen. With digital making, you actually get to see, touch, make mistakes with and modify that thing in your hands. It really hammers in concepts that you otherwise might not pay attention to. 

For a start, just setting up my Pi got me thinking about how the components of a computer fit together, from the USB keyboard and monitor, the ethernet connection, to the hard disk/microSD card I had to burn a Raspbian image to. These were all parts and connections I had always taken for granted when I could use a computer out-of-the-box or power up a desktop that had already been set up with an operating system. Perhaps to some geeks this would all be elementary, but for a beginner like me, it was like an interesting puzzle I had to slowly piece together. When, after lots of googling and reading documentations, I finally hooked everything up and saw the boot-up script running, it was very fulfilling. 

As I've been reading the MagPi magazine and exploring other Pi projects, one thing that has stood out, and indeed one thing that continues to surprise me about the tech world, is the strong sense of community good tech ecosystems build. With the open culture of sharing knowledge and tips, you feel like you belong to something larger than yourself. Of course, the journey doesn't stop when you find the answer to your problem or when you find the next idea for a project. You continue on, modifying what came before, building on it and then teaching others what you learned. The virtuous cycle then repeats itself, and the ecosystem grows.
